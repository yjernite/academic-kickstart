I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [FAIR NY](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/) lab, where I am currently working on unsupervised text summarization, long form question answering, and natural language interactions between human and machine.

Before this, I completed my PhD at New York University with [David Sontag](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dsontag/) working on language modeling, graphical models, and medical applications of natural language processing.
